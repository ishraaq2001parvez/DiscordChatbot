# DiscordChatbot
A discord chatbot which I made following this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjDpW_SOrlw

## In this project, I learned -
* How to work with the Discord Developer's Portal
* How to use Google Collab
* A very naive and basic introduction to machine learning
* To use various online tools such as HuggingFace, ReplIt and Uptime Monitor for creating, testing and monitoring my bot activity
* And lastly, Github Markdown :)

### Many thanks to @RuolinZheng08 for her wonderful tutorial!
